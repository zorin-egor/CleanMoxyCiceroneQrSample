        There are hundreds of festivals taking place every month all over the world.
        They are often connected with celebrations of certain holidays, for example, New Year Day,
        St. Patrick’s Day, Shrove Tuesday, Mother’s Day, May Day, Children’s Day, Halloween, etc.
        There are also some festivals, which are not connected with common holidays,
        but are cheerfully celebrated in certain countries. For example, Songkran – Thai New Year,
        La Tomatina, Oktoberfest, Glastonbury Festival, Guy Fawkes Night, Notting Hill Carnival, Holi.
